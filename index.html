                              <p>One of the most gruesome and psychopathic serial killers in American history is apparently really hot, according to the Netflix audiences.

                                    This follows news that Ted Bundy has been listed as the most googled man in the world this week – after millions of of people around the world tune into the new mini-series about the horrific crimes he perpetrated between between 1974 – 1978.
                                    
                                    “Yassss. He’s so hot” says one recently unemployed content aggregator from Buzzfeed.
                                    
                                    “He’s like Woody Harrelson in Natural Born Killers, but real. And so smart. Just so smart and so damn sexy”
                                    
                                    Bundy, a fairly well-spoken vagrant who raped and murdered upwards of 30 young women while on the run from the authorities in several different states in the mid-70s, has this week been knighted with the internet’s highest honour of ‘daddy’ – a title given to assertive white men who come across as mildly attractive despite problematic personality traits.
                                    
                                    However, not everyone agrees with calling this psychopathic stain on American history ‘sexy’.
                                    
                                    Jan Kintour, the CEO of Betoota’s most prominent modeling and talent agency, Golly-Hopkins, says she nearly passed out from laughter when she learnt that Zac Efron would be playing Ted Bundy in the upcoming glorified murderer rom-com about his life.
                                    
                                    “He’s no oil painting” she said.
                                    
                                    “He’s definitely not Zac Efron levels of sexy”
                                    
                                    “I thought those fat idiots from the Fyre documentary were sexier, to be honest. And that’s really saying something”</p>

                              <h3><a href="single-post.html">The nations greatest natural wonder has taken to it’s social media channels this morning to post an incredible transformation picture.

                                    Following the lead of celebrities across the globe and people you aren’t really friends with on your social media feed, the Great Barrier Reef posted a #TenYearChallenge photo on Facebook and Instagram today.
                                    
                                    The natural organism posted a photo of itself from 10 years ago, looking incredibly vibrant and colourful, alongside a photo of itself from this year looking incredibly bleached thanks to years of incessant coal mining and blatant inaction towards climate change by a string of both state and federal Governments.
                                    
                                    Demonstrating it’s cheeky and humorous side, the reef posted a caption on the photo saying; “Doing one of these #TenYearChallenges, haha OMG I used to be so tanned back then!”
                                    
                                    Speaking to The Advocate moments ago, the Reef said it thought it would be a great opportunity to get active again on it’s socials.
                                    
                                    “I haven’t posted anything since JT retired last year, so I thought I whack up the photo and have a little bit of fun,” the natural wonder said.
                                    
                                    The photo has received plenty of attention on social media, garnering nearly 2,000 sad reacts on the Facebook post.
                                    
                                    However, the post hasn’t been taken in good spirit by everyone, with One Nation leader Pauline Hanson hitting out at the reef.
                                    
                                    Accusing the reef of doctoring the picture using photoshop, Hanson slammed the tourist attraction for trying to promote unrealistic reef images.
                                    
                                    “The reef has clearly photoshopped that, or added a white filter over the top of the second image in some attempt to please the PC Brigade,” said Hanson.
                                    
                                    “It’s disgraceful if I’m honest.”</a></h3>

                              <p>A local man who probably smokes pot once every two years, has today decided that he must have a high tolerance to the THC in his mate’s new batch of brownies, and that one brownie wasn’t enough.

                                    Having never experimented with cannabis-infused edibles before, Scotty Maley (31) was more than eager to have a crack when his mate Shan brought some over today for a relaxed arvo Christmas catch up.
                                    
                                    With no kids around and the party thinning out a bit, Scotty decided it was time to tuck in, stubbornly ignoring any advice that was being offered to him by Shan or anyone else.
                                    
                                    After spending approximately five minutes of trying to decipher whether he felt anything or whether his hypersensitivity to light was a placebo, Scotty decides that these brownies must be either duds or extremely weak.
                                    
                                    “Haha. I’m not feeling anything. Are you guys feeling it?”
                                    
                                    “Screw it. I’m gonna have another. Haha”
                                    
                                    Once again ignoring the advice of others, Scotty mungs down another wildly potent chocolate brownie.
                                    
                                    At time of press Scotty was seen brushing his teeth with a dead pigeon he found behind a skip bin in the car park of his local Dan Murphy’s</p>

                              <p>A popular Bluetooth headphone manufacturer is set to launch a cutting edge bit of kit later this year – a wireless headset with enough battery life to last for an entire Joe Rogan Podcast.

                                    Known internationally for being the most popular, albeit longest podcast in Western society, the Joe Rogan Podcast often has a run time that pushes past the three-hour mark.
                                    
                                    Although many other Bluetooth headphone manufacturers have claimed their headsets last for up to 18 hours in some cases, it’s been proven time and time again that a Joe Rogan Podcast can only be listened to in its entirety with wired headphones or car stereo.
                                    
                                    AudioPoon, an Australian startup, is the company behind the stunning claims and their CEO, Kevin Fuck, spoke briefly to The Advocate this afternoon via SnapChat about his new headphones and their stellar battery life.
                                    
                                    “Our new product was born out of necessity,” said Fuck.
                                    
                                    “So many times, I’ve been down at TimeZone in the French Quarter, playing air hockey by myself for hours on end while I listen to the Joe Rogan Podcast – and the battery always runs out before it gets to the end!”
                                    
                                    “So I founded my company, developed a few new batteries – and here we are. Our new headphones, the JoeCDX1000 will be out later this year. We’ve had a few legal issues to iron out, though. I put a length of 2-inch gal pipe around a parking ranger’s head last November and the Crown wants me to serve time. It’s all a big misunderstanding, you know. I think the headphones will be out by August?”
                                    
                                    Mr Fuck declined to comment further on the alleged assault and then deleted our reporter from his SnapChat friends list.
                                    
                                    More to come.</p>

                              <p>In some breaking news out of Sydney, Academy Award-winning actor Geoffrey Rush has revealed to The Advocate that he is contemplating pulling ‘a spacey.’

                                    Rush told us of the drastic move after more allegations of inappropriate conduct were levelled at him.
                                    
                                    The allegations come from ‘Orange Is The New Black’ star Yael Stone, who made explosive claims that Rush exposed himself to her backstage, sent her sexually suggestive text messages, and attempted to spy on her while she was showering.
                                    
                                    The events happened in 2010 and 2011 during the play Diary of a Madman, and Stone says she is speaking publicly on the matter to help compel change in the entertainment industry.
                                    
                                    Rush has denied the allegations, but told us that despite his denial it might be time to pull ‘a spacey.’
                                    
                                    According to the American Law Society, The Spacey Defence is defined as: Publicly proclaiming that you’re gay when you get called out for committing inappropriate and/or criminal behaviour. 
                                    
                                    The theatre and film veteran explained that if things start to get sour he might be pulling The Spacey Defence in an attempt to distract and absolve himself a little.
                                    
                                    “Obviously with this defamation stuff about to be decided, and now this fresh set of allegations regarding behaviour that I may or may not have done that will tarnish my name, I think it’s time to come out as gay,” said the Thespian icon.
                                    
                                    “Hopefully it will make all this go away.”
                                    
                                    More to come.</p>

                              <p>Full time stay at home son, Jesse Wickens (34), never saw himself becoming an activist but has found himself fighting for the greater good, asking the question ‘what about men’s rights?’ from the comfort of his childhood home where his mum still does his laundry.

                                    Saunders claims that sexism is a problem that was solved in the ’60s and that he lives in an equal world where he worked hard for everything he has, which appears to be an Xbox 360 with two controllers his mum still buys the batteries for.
                                    
                                    “What about violence against men?” asked Wickens on an NRL Facebook post against domestic violence.
                                    
                                    “What are youse doin [sic] to stop violence against men?”
                                    
                                    Critics of the early balding activist have noted that he may not be the best person to discuss gender issues as his mother is responsible for the entirety of his domestic duties, despite the fact that he has spent so much time on the couch that it has changed his already appalling posture.
                                    
                                    “It’s not a bloody sexist thing, and not because sexism doesn’t exist, but because I don’t know how to do it and she does. What’s sexist about that?”
                                    
                                    “She doesn’t know a fucking thing on how to fish for Alaskan King Crabs. That kills heaps of men every year. Is that sexist or some new age bullshit now?”
                                    
                                    Wickens admits, he is not the ideal poster boy for men’s rights but claims to know several more impressive men’s rights activist who claim to have actually seen a woman naked, some without even paying for it.</p>
